But rarely in the history of Multiverse have Empires discovered how to breach the veil between worlds and colonise between universes and timelines. But like everything ever written down, all permutations are possible, and came an Empire which had yet to breach its own planet orbit but pierced through the fabric between universes, and began their own journey of colonialism in betwixt universes.</p>

An Empire that pierced the secrets of interuniversal travel in the wake of its great war, and began to spread among the different stories found in the Multiverse. Like room temperature bacteria, the Empire grows stronger and spreads furtherâ€¦ but what point to an Empire? Like all things, there must be a reason for Imperialism, and empty platitudes provided by Empire-states will not be enough to explain their imperialistic tendencies. The Empire contradicts itselves with its Commonwealth nature, their claims of democracy clashing with outlander barbarism and slavery, their claims of evil rendered irrelevant by the actions of good from their citizens. The state is a contradiction, for an Empire is never a monolithic leviathan, and instead a series of individuals acting out their own lives amidst a convoluted political structure. Backstabs, hope, glory, tragedy, horrors, joy, romance, and a variety more are found in the Empire.

            <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify"}}>To be a sapient in such times is to be one amongst uncatalogued trillions. To be in a state trying to assert its own ability to live up to its ideals yet struggling every step in trying to do so. To either live by ink or to be condemned to death by it. There is no such thing as a simple day in the Empire, for at the peak of civilization, the only enemy all must face is themselves and their ideals.

These states banded together to say 'never again' to the horrors of the Shattered War. The war where Pax Celestica finally ended in the flames of <strong>Burning Wednesday</strong>, a national crisis from which the once serene Principality shattered into pieces as weapons fell into the hooves and claws of radicals, ideologues, reformists, and all in between.

But the peace of these new states was fragile. All it took was just one bad day, one bad crash, one angry pony, and one unfortunate soul at the end of a barrel...

The Griffons went northwards to assist their Republican allies against the bugs. The Thestrals banded together in Central Equestria, surrounded by Revanchist Unicorn Armies, Rightist Communes, and a desperate Lunar Princess. Manehatten seceeded and declared for the end of the Principality permanently. Vanhoofer was seized by the followers of Larks and Bagel as their city was shelled by Crystallian Crusiers. And the Empire to the East, came in desperate, to try and stop the war that was wrecking their economy and secure themselves a proper supply of coal and crystals.

                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>When considering the universe, one must remember that in the logic of the Empire, that the universe of the Empire exists on, something that can be imagined as a 3D plane. These three axes determine the nature of the reality. There is the Alpha, Beta, and Delta axes. Of interest is the Beta Axis, in which could be best described as the 'seed' of a universe sort of like seeds in video games. Now, if one has a beta variable/seed of '48839SHDE', the variable next door of '48839SHF' would be almost similar, except for some minor modification. The larger the deviation, the more different the universe is. Interuniversal travel is often not possible due to the fact that there is an infinitely large distance between universes created by previous universes ceasing to exist due to fluctuations from higher Alpha layers. However, these infinite distances can be crossed as discovered by the Empire by using an anchor before creating the method of transportation. This can be done by, essentially taking something that represents as much of the material present within a given universe, like a book or data encrypted on a drive, and forcing it to jump into another universe using ludrcious amounts of energy. And once expelled from the origin universe, the book will maintain a vector that'll change to land into a nearby universe that holds close enough to its identity. Once landed, the origin universe can establish an easier link with the new universe through that anchor and create a more permanent link. 
                          </p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Thus, as the Empire began rebuilding, it inherited a project from the remnants of the Equestrian governments regarding interuniversal travel based on the writings of an old unicorn wizard. Deciding that this was a worthwhile project, the Empire chose to start pursuing it in earnest. Perhaps, a new world could be found. With its new wonders and so, that the Empire could in a way, repent for the horrors they've committed. 
                          </p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Instead, they found an Equestria on the brink of war and collapsing into war as their own world as. Parasitic and inefficient aristocrats choking out the principality, as claimed by a stallion that was exiled and whom they first discovered. <strong><NavLink to="/char/preventus-i-eye" className="link-color-unique">Preventus I Eye</NavLink></strong>. Adopted quickly into the Imperial Family, the Kaisar directed the Empire for an encroaching upon this world to bring about their ideals of Harmony they've managed to forged out of war. Drawing in the states of <strong><NavLink to="/nation/snowlandia" className="link-color-unique">Snowlandia</NavLink></strong> and <strong><NavLink to="/nation/calavaria" className="link-color-unique">Calavaria</NavLink></strong> into their sphere, the Empire moved to topple the corrupt regime and sought to bring about Democracy to the region. A coup, a civil war, and arms being shipped into <strong><NavLink to="/planet/equus-2" className="link-color-unique">Equestria-2</NavLink></strong> allowed for the Empire to claim for themselves a new democratic protectorcate in the new world under the reign of the aforementioned Preventus. But unbeknownst to the Empire and Her new found allies, the old rulers of Canterlot, <strong><NavLink to="/char/the-deciever" className="link-color-unique">the Deciever</NavLink></strong>, ran off along with the rest of her deviled possy into other worlds to convince other Equestrias to launch a crusade back against the Empire.
                          </p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>An alliance of states were gathered up by the Deciever, and declaring the birth of the <strong><NavLink to="/nation/restorationist-equestrian-coalition" className="link-color-unique">Restorationist Equestrian Coalition</NavLink></strong>, they opened up portals once more on the eastside of the newly founded state of <strong><NavLink to="/nation/mleocun" className="link-color-unique">Mleocun</NavLink></strong> to take back their deceitful rule. The Empire battled with the Coalition. The Empire, a child of war, fostering along itself several younger nations with it as they picked up the sword once more to advance against their enemies, horrid autocrats and corrupt rulers. The Coalition, steadied itself as they prepared themselves for a righteous reclaimation and liberation of their old world. Both sides, did not knew of just how bad the war was going to become as by the second year, a stalemate occured on the center mountain ridges of Mleocun and the fighting grew bitter and regressed.</p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>The old nature of trench warfare slowly creeped back in. A novelty to the numerically superior Coalition and an ancient horror for the technologically ascendent Empire. Both sides saw themselves spiral into a feast of barbarism in the battles of the Mideast of Mleocun. With trench lines scattered up and down the Mareisisipi river, and often mountains serving as just but another type of land to dig trenches in. Each side saw themselves trading lives for inches of trenches that may with ease be retaken by the enemy for an equivalent magnitude of lives. A horror which saw notable rivers clogged up with bodies. </p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>And when stagnation set in by the third year of fighting, desperation creeped its ugly head over the horizon to both sides as it increasingly became clear that the war will not end easily. Trench raids grew increasingly common, as so was the deployment of mustard gas as the Empire rolled out old tactics to break Coalition Lines. The Coalition responded by increasingly growing dependent on magically enhanced soldiers for desperate breakthroughs, and using spells to cast foul curses on Imperial troops. The Empire responded in kind with continued development of bioweapons and incidenary weapons. Incinerating all those that survived plagues and horrific monstrosities. But like all ladders, there was another rung to climb. And another. First came spells, then <strong><NavLink to="/concept/memetics" className="link-color-unique">Memetics</NavLink></strong>, then plaguebombs, then antimemetic viruses, then virulent pathogens. The trench battles slowly lost any sense of limitation to trenches. With powerful weapons, hundreds of kilometres of trenches could be lost in a day due to a particularly effective self replicating memetic attack driving all soldiers within it insane, or a particularly dastardly bioweapon simply murdering them all. Cities were levelled as gunfire traded fire with screeching noises of hell, virulent disease, and constant bombing. But yet, this was all still relatively limited to Mleocun. The main field of battle.</p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>The war kept going on, first a decade, then another, then a third more, then a century. By this point, the MineLegoEquestrians and arcane defectors from the Coalition had begun developing early motic-based genetic engineering, to try and stave off extinction from a weapon that both sides knew they both had. Nuclear weapons.</p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Unlike all the weapons of war they've deployed, nuclear weapons could verily easily be deployed and attempt to be delivered cross universes. Memetics required sapient vectors, which by now had been particularly exhausted by either genetic upgrades, arcane shielding, or simple raw survival making them unviable. Biological warfare became harder to use as troops grew more knowledgable in how to stop such spreads, using their masks and combat suits as second skins. Everything was slowly being countered, but nuclear weapons. </p>
                          <br/>
                          <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Both sides can't really stop nuclear weapons, more of the effect that both sides had no possible idea how one would utilize them effectively and prevent a second strike from the enemy. But the thought of escalating the ladder became more and more of a thought for the Coalition as the Empire slowly took ground. Mechanised warfare had rolled back in after multiple failed attempts, and the lines were drawn near the East Coast. With the centre of operations Manehatten on the line for collapse. The call was made.</p>
