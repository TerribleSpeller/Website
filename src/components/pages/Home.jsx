                   Nice to meet you, I'm TerribleSpeller. Welcome to my website! This website serves as an online portfolio and introduction to me, my projects, and my various idiosyncrasies for all those unintiated. Plus, it saves time on introductions and also allows me to get good at web developing so that I can actually properly develop my actual IRL personal site along with giving me practice in such so that I can possibly gain employment from it.</p>
