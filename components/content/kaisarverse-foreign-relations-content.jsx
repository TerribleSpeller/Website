                        Due to the nature of the world, there is no way a state can be the sole state within the world. Thus, there are other states that we must interact with. The range of states that the Empire interacts with are quite numerous and varies. Through these interactions, the Empire aims to forwards its national interests and the interests of the common populace. MineLegoEquestrians aims to forward three types of principles in its interactions on the international stage. Harmony, Prosperity, and Justice. Chaos is a destructive force that destroys the stability and peace all the people want. It is evil in the pursuit of freedom of beings who have no care for freedom of others. It is must be prevented, for it is an evil entropic force that aims to destroy civilisation. Thus Harmony must be advocated to prevent such a reality. Poverty destroys the sapient ability to fulfil their meaning. It rips out of the their mandibles their ability to do what is right. Because of that people must be lifted out of evil and lack into good and abundnance. Thus Prosperity must be advocated. If a man shoots another, many would consider that wrong or right. There is a dichotomy here that implies the existence of a standard. The standard that can bring about what is true should be done. Thus Justice must be adocated for.

                        The Empire's foreign policy is geared towards creating an environment wich may provide the Empire plentitude of allies that prevent the outbreak of an all encompassing conflict. The prevention of an all encompassing conflict has been a result of experience within the context of the <Link href="/worlds/kaisarverse/empire/history/great-multiverse-war" className="link-color-unique">Great Multiverse War</Link>, and thus, most efforts had been to do so to prevent such a large war. From this, most diplomatic outreach efforts have taken the form of economic projects, military defense pacts, and military interventions.

                        In addition to such, the Empire also engages in blantant colonialism against more underdeveloped states and peoples. The justification for these actions are often under the issue for assisting them in order to be uplifted in a more efficient manner. This policy of 'Harmonic Imperialism' is often accompanied by forced infrastrucutal development, sheer CDI upgrades by several multitudes, and a whole lot of settler colonialism. The actual benefits from these policies are debated. But there's obviously effects.

                    <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"textAlign":"justify"}}>
                        The foreign policy of the Empire has evolved over time and has been shaped by various factors such as its historical context, multiversal contacts, national interests, and leadership. Here is an overview of the historical context of the Empire's foreign policy:
                    </p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Founding Principles: The Empire is founded with the aims and goals of protecting the interests of its constituent states. And thus the Empire acts based on such principles.</li>
                        <li>Territorial Integrity: The Empire places great importance on its territorial soverignty. And thus efforts are made to ensure that the Empire's territories remain safe from foreign interventions and rebellions from within it.</li>
                        <li>Societal Development: The Empire also places importance on societal development within and without its borders. If possible, the Empire encourages societal development through foreign aid, military intervention, and bilateral cooperation between states. </li>
                        <li>Economic Development: The Empire is going through what many consider a 'malpopulation crisis'. With the Empire having much capability to expand and consists of a lot of land, but not enough people to develop it. And thus, the Empire seeks out populous and growing states by securing economic ties, exchanging national development for manpower for the Empire to develop itself effectively. </li>
                        <li>Commonwealth and Extra-Commonwealth Multilateralism: The Empire participates in various multilateral organizations with a goal to contribute to peace, security, and prosperity among nations. Usually by hosting and facilitating multilateral dialogues and fostering cooperation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Significant International Memberships</h3>
                    <hr/>
                    <h4>Commonwealth Cooperation Organisation (CCO)</h4>
                    <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"textAlign":"justify"}}>
                        The cornerstone of Imperial Foreign Diplomacy is its participation in the <Link href="/worlds/kaisarverse/org/commonwealth-cooperation-organisation" className="link-color-unique">Commonwealth Cooperation Organisation</Link>. Created by the Empire itself, the organisation serves as a forum for what is informally known as the 'Commonwealth System', and is hosts the 'The Commonwealth Council' and serves as the basis for the transnational Commonwealth ministries including the International Astronomical Coordination Ministry, the Multiversal Managements Ministry, International Interdimensional Portal Management Ministry, and the International Climate Management Ministry. 
                    </p> 
                    <br/>
                    <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"textAlign":"justify"}}>
                        The CCO hosts its Commonwealth Council within the Imperial Capital of MinLegtian Kantelouh, where it regularly engages in dialogue and coordinates with its Member States regarding international issues and work with them in order to achieve its foreign policy objectives. Without the CCO, most contemporary scholars agree that the Empire would not be able to retain such an influence it has now as the organisation as a whole acts as a testament to the capbilities of the Empire and its commitment to treaties and peaceful dialogue. 
                    </p> 
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Confederation of Corrupt Dictators (CCD)</h4>
                    <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"textAlign":"justify"}}>
                        The sheer absurdity of a semi-democratic state participating in the <Link href="https://www.nationstates.net/region=confederation_of_corrupt_dictators" className="link-color-unique">Confederation of Corrupt Dictators</Link> sort of fades when one remembers that the semi-democratic state is still an Empire. The Empire attempts to serve as a moral guide for a divisive organisation of states, and in addition in order to accquire cheap resources from politiically isolated states. The Empire insists that's what they're doing. Totally. 
                    </p> 
                    <br/>
                    <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"textAlign":"justify"}}>
                        The Actong-Kaisar also currently serves as the Minister of Home Affairs for the organisation due to the Empire's contribution to regional stability.

                                    The relations between the Multiversal Empire and this state can be considered friendly due to the Empire supporting its independence during the South Eastern Insurgency.
