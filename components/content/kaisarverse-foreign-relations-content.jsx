                        Due to the nature of the world, there is no way a state can be the sole state within the world. Thus, there are other states that we must interact with. The range of states that the Empire interacts with are quite numerous and varies. Through these interactions, the Empire aims to forwards its national interests and the interests of the common populace. MineLegoEquestrians aims to forward three types of principles in its interactions on the international stage. Harmony, Prosperity, and Justice. Chaos is a destructive force that destroys the stability and peace all the people want. It is evil in the pursuit of freedom of beings who have no care for freedom of others. It is must be prevented, for it is an evil entropic force that aims to destroy civilisation. Thus Harmony must be advocated to prevent such a reality. Poverty destroys the sapient ability to fulfil their meaning. It rips out of the their mandibles their ability to do what is right. Because of that people must be lifted out of evil and lack into good and abundnance. Thus Prosperity must be advocated. If a man shoots another, many would consider that wrong or right. There is a dichotomy here that implies the existence of a standard. The standard that can bring about what is true should be done. Thus Justice must be adocated for.

                        The Empire's foreign policy is geared towards creating an environment wich may provide the Empire plentitude of allies that prevent the outbreak of an all encompassing conflict. The prevention of an all encompassing conflict has been a result of experience within the context of the <Link href="/worlds/kaisarverse/empire/history/great-multiverse-war" className="link-color-unique">Great Multiverse War</Link>, and thus, most efforts had been to do so to prevent such a large war. From this, most diplomatic outreach efforts have taken the form of economic projects, military defense pacts, and military interventions.

                        In addition to such, the Empire also engages in blantant colonialism against more underdeveloped states and peoples. The justification for these actions are often under the issue for assisting them in order to be uplifted in a more efficient manner. This policy of 'Harmonic Imperialism' is often accompanied by forced infrastrucutal development, sheer CDI upgrades by several multitudes, and a whole lot of settler colonialism. The actual benefits from these policies are debated. But there's obviously effects.

                        Given its geographic and demographic size, impressive capabilities and diplomatic initiatives, scholars have classified the Empire as one of the known multiverse's superpowers.

                        The foreign policy of the Empire has evolved over time and has been shaped by various factors such as its historical context, multiversal contacts, national interests, and leadership. Here is an overview of the historical context of the Empire's foreign policy:
